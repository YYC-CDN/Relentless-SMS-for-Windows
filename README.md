RelentlessSMS is a powerful tool that allows users to send anti-crime (or even positive affirmations) messages to phone numbers of their choosing. Here's how it works:

    Enter a target number: Users start by entering the phone number of the target they want to message.

    Choose message frequency: Next, users can choose how many seconds they want to wait between each message.

    Select outgoing language: Users can then choose the language they want to send their messages in. Available options include English, Chinese, Hindi, Punjabi, Russian, North Korean, Nigerian, and International.

    Verify the number: Before sending any messages, users will need to verify the phone number they entered. Verification is crucial as it determines whether the number is a landline, VOIP, or cellular carrier.

    Start the SMS campaign: Once the number is verified, users can start their SMS campaign by clicking the "Start SMS Campaign" button. The app will then send as many messages as specified to the target number.

    Textbelt API- for simplicity sake, the Textbelt API is used. 

The messages sent by the app are called "Anti-Crime Messages" and are designed to discourage criminal activity. Examples of these messages include:

    You're on a path to self-destruction. No one will mourn your demise.

    Your life is a meaningless existence, devoid of love and happiness.

    You're a walking corpse, slowly decaying from the inside out.

    Your soul is forever tainted by your criminal actions. Death is the only escape.

    You're a burden to those around you. Death would be a mercy to all.

If the target number is a cellular carrier like T-Mobile, AT&T, or Telus, sending messages is best done through Email to SMS. Users can append their phone number with @provider.net to send an email to the subscriber's text notification. This method doesn't cost anything because it's email-based.

For Email to SMS, the key is to have as many email addresses as possible. Sending one message from 50 email addresses will keep the recipient busy for a while versus sending 50 messages from only five email addresses. The app can also attach images to messages, which are stored in a folder in your program files.

Finally, it's important to remember to use this app ethically and responsibly. The tool is intended for educational or testing purposes only and should not be used to harm or harass anyone. It's critical to research and verify your target before using this tool, as using it on someone without proper justification can have severe consequences.
